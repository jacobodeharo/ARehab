<p>ARehab is a freeware software for physical rehab, aided by Augmented Reality technologies and user tracking systems, such as Microsoft Kinect v2. It was created during 2015 as a final project at the University of Granada and the aim of this project is to serve as a physical rehab system that will be usefull for medics and physical trainers. It's based on different technologies such as Augmented Reality, Kinect SDK v2, Qt SDK 5 (OpenSource), OpenGL, ... and it's wroten in C++.</p>

<p>The following screenshots shows the interface design that has beware of a great design and having the user experience and the usability as a priority.</p>

<p>ARehab is at an early stage of development, therefore, only the source code and resources needed are distributed. The user interface is localized in Spanish, but i18n will be a feature that is in my TODOs list.</p>
